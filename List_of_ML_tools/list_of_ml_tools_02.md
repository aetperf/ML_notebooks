# Some more cool open-source Python packages for Machine Learning

There is a very rich ecosystem of Python libraries related to ML. Here is a list of some "active", open-source packages that may be useful for ML day-to-day activities. Of course, this list is far from being exhaustive and should evolve as fast as the Python ecosystem does. Also, we exclude from the current list: 
* main ML algorithm frameworks ([scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), ...), 
* famous user-friendly libraries built on top of deep-learning libraries ([fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), ...), 
* specific application-oriented libraries ([spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy), [scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image), [StellarGraph](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph), ...),
* packages dealing with the general data/analytics environment ([JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), [Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask), [Conda](https://github.com/conda/conda), ...) that are also used in many other domains, even if some of the following tools are more on the data-engineering side than on the ML one.

We hope you will find this list informative and useful!

## Feature engineering

* [dirty_cat](https://github.com/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/) - dirty_cat helps with machine-learning on non-curated categories, by providing encoders that are robust to morphological variants, such as typos, in the category strings.

## ML pipeline

* [papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) - a tool for parameterizing, executing, and analyzing Jupyter Notebooks.

## Workflow management system

* [prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) - a workflow management system, designed for modern infrastructure and powered by the open-source Prefect Core workflow engine. 

## Data visualization

* [kepler.gl](https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl) - a powerful open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets (with a jupyter widget, to render large-scale interactive maps in Jupyter Notebook.).

* [glue](https://glueviz.org/) - a library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.

## Models

* [pytorch-transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers) - a library of state-of-the-art pre-trained models for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
