There is a very rich ecosystem of Python libraries related to ML. Here is a list of some “active”, open-source packages that may be useful for ML day-to-day activities.

This post is following these ones:

## Data summarization

* [apricot](https://github.com/jmschrei/apricot) - a package for the greedy selection of diverse subsets of data from massive data sets using submodular selection. 

## Auto-ML

* [AutoGluon](https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon) - enables easy-to-use and easy-to-extend AutoML with a focus on deep learning and real-world applications spanning image, text, or tabular data.

## Time series

* [GluonTS](https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/) - a toolkit for probabilistic time series modeling, built around Apache MXNet. GluonTS provides utilities for loading and iterating over time series datasets, state of the art models ready to be trained, and building blocks to define your own models and quickly experiment with different solutions.
* [ADTK](https://github.com/arundo/adtk) - Anomaly Detection Toolkit (ADTK) is a package for unsupervised / rule-based time series anomaly detection.

## REST API endpoints

* [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) - a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Conversational framework

* [Rasa](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa) - a machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. With Rasa, you can build contexual assistants on Facebook Messenger, Slack, Microsoft Bot Framework, Rocket.Chat, Mattermost, Telegram, Twilio, your own custom conversational channels... or voice assistants as: Alexa Skills, Google Home Actions.

## NLP

* [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) - a very simple framework for state-of-the-art NLP. Developed by Zalando Research.
* [Snips NLU](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu) - Snips NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is a Python library that allows to extract structured information from sentences written in natural language.
* [FastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) - an open-source, free, lightweight library that allows users to learn text representations and text classifiers. It works on standard, generic hardware. Models can later be reduced in size to even fit on mobile devices.

## Graphs

* [DGL](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl) - a package built to ease deep learning on graph, on top of existing DL frameworks.
* [Higra](https://github.com/higra/Higra) - a C++/Python library for efficient sparse graph analysis with a special focus on hierarchical methods.

## Music

* [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) - Spleeter is the Deezer source separation library with pretrained models written in Python and uses Tensorflow. It makes it easy to train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides already trained state of the art model for performing various flavour of separation.
.

## Miscellaneous tools

* [Knock Knock](https://github.com/huggingface/knockknock) - a small library to get a notification when your training is complete or when it crashes during the process with two additional lines of code.
* [nbgather](https://github.com/microsoft/gather) - Tools for cleaning code, recovering lost code, and comparing versions of code in Jupyter Lab (this is actually not a Python package but a JupyterLab extension).
* [perfplot](https://github.com/nschloe/perfplot) - perfplot extends Python's `timeit` by testing snippets with input parameters (e.g., the size of an array) and plotting the results.
